# WEBDEVELOPMENT COURSE EXERCISES 
#HTML tags


#1
- Make a main page where two images will be inserted, one from Google, the other from your own project folder, and the text will go to the other page when you click on it.
There should also be a text which, when clicked, will open another site in a new tab.

#2

- On the second page there will be a list, both types. From here it should be possible to go to the third page (you can list links to all pages).

#3
- On the third page we will have a table where column titles and data must be separated.

#4

- On the fourth page there will be a form where the inputs of name, email, password, gender, pets, date of birth, profile picture will be placed. It should also be possible to return to the main page. Inputs should have a text that appears before writing something (if it is possible to appear), as well as some of them should be mandatory. 
It should be highlighted when you click on its text.
